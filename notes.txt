mostly from Dodelson, "Modern Cosmology" - pp.366, 372..

*fisher MX is defd as

 F_ab = < - d^2 lnL / dp_a dp_b >

*for gaussian distributed data this is

 F_ab = 0.5 * d^2 chi^2/dp_a dp_b

writing out the 2nd derivative results in a second term (11.123)
that can be dropped, giving (11.125)

F_ab = sum_i (dC_i/dp_a) (dC_i/dp_b) * (1/sigma_i)^2

where the C_i are the observables with uncertainties sigma_i.

the second term is proportional to
(C_i,true - C_i,obs)
which disappears in the ensemble average. See discussion at end of
sec 15.5 (NR 2nd ed.).

progress today:
1) numpy arrays are pointers! your derivatives may not be zero if you know that.
2) remove extra factor from analytical expression visibility (to get integrals of 1-norm'd fcns)
3) missing sqrt(8ln2) put in
4) increase frac step size for numerical derivs to 1%
5) set vis err to be of order vis val in fish mx calc
6) work out a couple of analytic test cases - analytic code passes the test.
