mostly from Dodelson, "Modern Cosmology" - pp.366, 372..

*fisher MX is defd as

 F_ab = < - d^2 lnL / dp_a dp_b >

*for gaussian distributed data this is

 F_ab = 0.5 * d^2 chi^2/dp_a dp_b

writing out the 2nd derivative results in a second term (11.123)
that can be dropped, giving (11.125)

F_ab = sum_i (dC_i/dp_a) (dC_i/dp_b) * (1/sigma_i)^2

where the C_i are the observables with uncertainties sigma_i.

the second term is proportional to
(C_i,true - C_i,obs)
which disappears in the ensemble average. See discussion at end of
sec 15.5 (NR 2nd ed.).

progress today:
1) numpy arrays are pointers! your derivatives may not be zero if you know that.
2) remove extra factor from analytical expression visibility (to get integrals of 1-norm'd fcns)
3) missing sqrt(8ln2) put in
4) increase frac step size for numerical derivs to 1%
5) set vis err to be of order vis val in fish mx calc
6) work out a couple of analytic test cases - analytic code passes the test.

========================

Cycle 3, Band 3 angular scales
 from C3 THB ch7 (100 GHz)

 theta_res, theta_MRS
7m    15" -> 43"

C36-1 3.4" , 25"
-2    1.8" , 25"
-3    1.2" , 25"
-4    0.7" , 10"
-5    0.5", 8"
-6    0.3", 5"
-7    0.1", 1.5"
-8    0.08", 1.1"

First thought: examine the range theta_res/4 -> 2*theta_MRS for each.

========================

plots to make

source FWHM/PB FWHM (x) vs Norm/Sigma(norm) on y - constant surface brightness
  source FWHM/PB FWHM (x) vs Norm/Sigma(norm) on y - constant surface brightness - with only norm free (for comparison to previous)
source FWHM/PB FWHM (x) vs Norm/Sigma(norm) on y - constant flux density
source FWHM/PB FWHM (x) vs inferredFWHM/Sigma(inferredFWHM) on y - constant surface brightness
source FWHM/PB FWHM (x) vs inferredFWHM/Sigma(inferredFWHM) on y - constant flux density

changes
* deg->rad for axis_angle
* optimized step size computation for numerical derivative using NR 5.7, center difference (5.7.8)
